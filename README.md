# CHU planner project

## Intro

This project is about creating team planning in hospital context.
At first, I thought about only doing one and as results were interesting, some other friends made a request
to try to create another planning for their team.

The very first project is `01-rea-12h` directory has an interesting [README](01-rea-12h/README.md) to read.
It explains all the logic behind and is a complete example from scratch. The actual planning in used one
of the program output (which is pretty satisfying).

The second project `02-ephad-pml` is about feasability. A specific request has been asked by pml (pseudonym)
to try to create a planning with a mix of 12h and 7h30 shift to try to get better working conditions, especially
on the week end. This project was finally abandonned because no viable solution were found. This directory holds
the last version of the work as is.
